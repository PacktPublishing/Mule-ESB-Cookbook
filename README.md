## What is this book about?
Mule ESB is a lightweight Java-based enterprise service bus (ESB) and integration platform that allows developers to connect applications together quickly and easily, enabling them to efficiently exchange data. You can therefore use Mule ESB to allow different applications to communicate with each other via a transit system to carry data between applications within your enterprise or across the Internet. It is also useful if you use more than one type of communication protocol while integrating three or more applications/services.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Learn how to work with components, workflow, and patterns, and how to configure them
* Understand message sources, processors, and properties
* Learn what an endpoint is and how you can configure this endpoint in your workflow
* Understand transformers and how you can use them in your workflow
* Learn about different types of filters and how to use them
* Understand exception handling and unit testing with MuleESB
* Create web services and integrate them in your workflow
* Learn how to create a flow and how to use routers and services
* Learn how you can use a cloud connector in the flow
* Understand how to use processors in your workflow
